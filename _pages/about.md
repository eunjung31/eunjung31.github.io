Welcome!

My name is Eunjung Yeo. 
I received my M.A. and Ph.D. in Linguistics from Seoul National University, where I worked in the Spoken Language Processing Lab. Before that, I completed my bachelor's degree in Korean Language and Literature, with a double major in Psychology, at Yonsei University. I am currently a visiting scholar at [ChangeLing Lab](https://changelinglab.github.io/), Language Technologies Institute of Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. David Mortensen](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dmortens/). 

My major interests are computational phonetics and phonology, with a particular focus on clinical speech analysis and applications. My research passion comes from making a world where everyone can convey their messages to the world. I have a strong belief that linguistic knowledge can be leveraged to enhance speech technologies for individuals.
