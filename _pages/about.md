Welcome!

My name is Eunjung Yeo. 
I received my M.A. and Ph.D. in Linguistics from Seoul National University, where I worked in the Spoken Language Processing Lab. Before that, I completed my bachelor's degree in Korean Language and Literature, with a double major in Psychology, at Yonsei University. I am currently a visiting scholar at the Language Technologies Institute of Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Dr. David Mortensen](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dmortens/). I also collaborate closely with [Dr. Christina Bjorndahl](https://christinabjorndahl.com/) in the Philosophy Department, CMU, [Dr. Julie Liss](https://search.asu.edu/profile/50291), and [Dr. Visar Berisha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MQBn718AAAAJ&hl=en) at Arizona State University. 

As a computational linguist, my major interests are phonetics and phonology, with a particular focus on clinical speech.
