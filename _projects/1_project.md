Since the beginning of my Ph.D. journey, I have dedicated my research to advancing cross-language intelligibility assessment for dysarthric speech. While speech AI has made significant strides, much of the technology remains heavily biased toward English, leaving speakers of low-resource languages underserved. By developing cross-language intelligibility assessment tools, I aim to address this disparity, ensuring equitable access to speech AI for individuals with speech pathologies across diverse linguistic backgrounds. 

n {% cite yeo2022multilingual %}, we extended this analysis to include phoneme-level pronunciation features, expanding the scope of features, and incorporated Tamil dysarthric speech to broaden the linguistic coverage.

In {% cite yeo2022cross %}, we proposed a classification method that considers both language-independent and language-dependent features, offering a more comprehensive approach to cross-language intelligibility assessment.

In {% cite yeo2023speech %}, we introduced an enhanced Goodness of Pronunciation (GoP) score tailored for pathological speech analysis. By leveraging the Common Phone dataset, our method demonstrates applicability across multiple languages. Additionally, we analyzed the relative importance of each phoneme for intelligibility scores, revealing that the significance of specific phonemes varies across languages.
