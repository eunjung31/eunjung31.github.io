Since the beginning of my Ph.D. journey, I have dedicated my research to advancing cross-language intelligibility assessment for dysarthric speech. While speech AI has made significant strides, much of the technology remains heavily biased toward English, leaving speakers of low-resource languages underserved. By developing cross-language intelligibility assessment tools, I aim to address this disparity, ensuring equitable access to speech AI for individuals with speech pathologies across diverse linguistic backgrounds.
