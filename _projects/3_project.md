Dysarthric speech faces significant challenges due to data scarcity, which hampers the application of recently developed neural network models. One promising approach to address this issue is the use of data augmentation techniques for dysarthric speech. I have recently initiated a collaboration with my labmate [Chin-Jou Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chin-jou-li), my longtime colleagues [Dr. Rohan Kumar Das](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=V8XFDQcAAAAJ), [Dr. Zhengjun Yue](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5_TTTUMAAAAJ), and my advisor [Prof. David Mortensen](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dmortens/).
