[ChangeLing Lab](https://changelinglab.github.io/) is a hub of expertise in computational linguistics, with a particular emphasis on phonetics, phonology, and morphophonology. If you share an interest in this field, I highly recommend exploring the following: 

* [Allovera](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08031), Multilingual allophone database
* [Allosaurus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11800), Universal phone recognizer
* [PanPhon](https://aclanthology.org/C16-1328.pdf), Mapping IPA Segments to Articulatory Feature
* [Epitran](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2018/pdf/890.pdf), G2P for Many Languages


We are currently advancing research on a universal phone recognizer as a follow-up study to *Allosaurus*, aiming to expand its capabilities and applications. üêÅ
